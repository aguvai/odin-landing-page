This is a landing page I developed as a part of The Odin Project's curriculum!

This project uses the foundational CSS3 and HTML5 skills that I've learned so far in the course, including flex containers and items, semantic HTML structure, layout spacing with padding and margin, typography styling with font weights and sizes, and more.
