This is a landing page I developed as a part of The Odin Project's curriculum!

The project demonstrates the foundational CSS3 and HTML5 skills I've learned so far in the course, including flex containers and items, semantic HTML structure, layout spacing with padding and margin, typography styling with font weights and sizes, and other core CSS design fundamentals.
